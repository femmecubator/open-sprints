## Project Name Trivia

Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a strong, athletic, and lively little herder, the world's most popular herding breeds. At 10 to12 inches at the shoulder and 27 to 30 pounds, a well-built male Pembroke presents a big dog in a small package. They can be red, sable, fawn, and black and tan, with or without white markings. The Pembroke is a bright, sensitive dog who enjoys play with his human family and responds well to training.

## Work Plan Overview

### Deliverable

In this research, the team will: 
- define critical phases to define in the Journey Map: ie. Onboarding, Editing, Deployment of Content on Github Pages
- synthesize and connect research-driven data, must be able to validate why certain features are needed to enable team sign ups (mentor volunteers + users)
- create alternate artifacts ie: a clear documentation to guide new users to join or post their own project


<br />

### Current State

The landing page today has very minimal information to introduce Open Sprints A.) as a project aggregator; and B.) a workathon event that enables new grads to work on projects within a team structure through seasonal fellowship work.

### POV Statement and High-level Product Vision

Phase 1: Open Sprints is a workathon event and a digital workspace, that enables new grads to work on projects within a team structure. 

Phase 2: In the future, we want this space to be a resource site that grads can co-build together. Much like wikipedia - it becomes a user-generated content submission site. 

Moodboard and Inspiration - other user generated sites https://dev.to/ and Course Hero.

### Team Goal

Perferendis suscipit repellat. Sint iusto minima eum. Delectus accusamus enim aut quae quisquam omnis quo. Maxime nam impedit quis distinctio eum rerum accusamus sed reiciendis.

<br />

## Proposal

Before jumping on the journey map, team should get a clear understanding of who the users are, and what their motivation is for joining.

### Jobs to be done
What outcomes do grad fellows, contributors expect? Example questions. 
- As a fellow, I apply to get accepted as for the annual workathon cohort
- As a code contributor, how do I get onboarded, edit / fork the Github repo and publish contribution
- As a workathon participant, is there an application process? Am I eligible?


### Scope
- Focus will be on main users of Open Sprints: fellows and code contributors. Partners and Sponsors are out of scope.
- Open Sprints work in a B2B model. We partner with training schools for coding and design, ie. Flatiron School NYC.


## Constraints and Challenges

Content - Possible gaps in content on application journey, and contributing code Currently, these information are hosted on Notion or read me docs. 
Platform limitation - the page is hosted on a docs site called Docusaurus for easy updates. Docusaurus does enable CSS customization but it’s not a full CMS site. 
Minimal architecture changes are allowed. We cannot add new pages unless it’s a critical change.
Consider downstream maintenance. Content should be evergreen as updates might not be down frequently.
