### Getting Started

Welcome Mentors and Builders!

Welcome Mentors and Cohort Fellows! 

We are so excited to work with you. This project's focus will be on product design and research. 
Over the next few weeks, you’ll have the opportunity to gain real-world experience in how to run UX workshops, while collaborating on a team of talented peers, product designers, and experienced mentors. 

This guide should give you an overview of what is to come!
