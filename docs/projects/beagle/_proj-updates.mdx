### Getting Started

Welcome Mentors and Cohort Fellows!

We are so excited to have you embark with us on this four-week journey into the world of design systems. 

Over the next few weeks, youâ€™ll have the opportunity to gain real-world experience in component building as part of an enterprise design system, while collaborating on a team of talented peers, product designers, and experienced mentors. 

This guide should give you an overview of what is to come!
