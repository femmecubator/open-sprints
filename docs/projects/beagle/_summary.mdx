## Project Name Trivia

This feature is named after the Beagle.

Beagle, a small hound dog breed popular as both a pet and a hunter. It looks like a small foxhound and has large brown eyes, hanging ears, and a short coat, usually a combination of black, tan, and white. The Beagle is a solidly built dog, heavy for its height. It generally excels as a rabbit hunter and is typically an alert, affectionate dog.

## Work Plan Overview​
### Deliverable​
Create a demo Component Library that is deployed on Storybook for WeSparkle. 
MVP build requires an estimated number 5 components, where a developer owns one component from build, test, document and publish.

### Current State​
There's initial work on a Figma document that stores a collection of design data with global colors and typography that will serve as the stylesheet of the components. In the DS world, this is called a “foundations document”. This document should be finalized in Figma exported as json code and published on a Design Token repo.

### Team Goal​
Expand frontend development and design skills by learning the Design System process

<br />

## Proposal​
The brand we are using for this round is WeSparkle, a startup geared towards women entrepreneurs. 

Ultimately, our call to action is to build a WeSparkle Theme and share this to future clients needing to build a simple component library.

The deliverable is a working Storybook that can be used for future Design System projects.

## Constraints​
<p> 1) Pre-work is needed for design to export the design tokens for color and type styles. Estimated ~1 month time is needed for pre-work. </p>
<p> 2) Provide swimlanes for the limited amount of time for component health. What is the actual time that it takes to ensure that the build is stable? </p>

## Audience
- React and Frontend Developers - with interest in frontend development and have React.JS knowledge
- UI Designers - with visual design skills, knows how to use Figma and flex their UI skills
