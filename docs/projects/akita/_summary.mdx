## Project Name Trivia

This feature is named after the Akita dog.

The Akita is a muscular, double-coated dog of ancient Japanese lineage famous for
their dignity, courage, and loyalty. In their native land, they're venerated as family
protectors and symbols of good health, happiness, and long life.

## Work Plan Overview

### Deliverable
Develop a documentation site for Open Sprints, a collaborative workspace for digital content editors, hackathon participants (aspiring designers and developers) and experienced mentors.
<br />

### Current State
The landing page is in pre-launch phase. It contains an event launch messaging that enables participation from volunteers (quick definition, roadmap, get involved). Outside of the landing page, Open Sprints is a community hackathon event that has not launched yet.
<br />

### Team Goal
> Open Sprints mission is to teach early-career techies gain confidence in building within an agile-driven environment.â€¨
<br />

## Proposal
Open Sprints landing page may have gaps in the experience. Ensure that the experience has a way for volunteer and mentors to sign up and so that partners also understand the overall mission and vision of both the community event and the long term goals of the org.
<br />

Ultimately, our call to action is to align the messaging to different set of target audience:
<p> 1) enable application process for project mentors </p>
<p> 2) attract volunteers who will be maintainers of the site (Markdown content editors, PR Reviews, General Maintenance) </p>
<p> 3) provide a way for participants to join projects and in-person workathon. </p>

## Constraints and Challenges
- Dynamic data or Third-party API embedding. The system should be able to string the Airtable Form into the landing page
- Think ahead for sustainable solutions and downstream maintenance. For example, the contributor page may have to be built manually now, but can be refined later to use Airtable gallery view embedding on a page 
- Tech team should be able to plan the maturity path and phase what's MVP and what's beyond scope for these experiences.
