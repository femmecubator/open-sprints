## Project Name Trivia

Dachshunds come in two sizes and come in three coat types: smooth, wirehaired, or longhaired. With their unmistakable long-backed body, little legs, and big personality, they’re truly an icon of purebred dogdom.   Dachshunds can be standard-sized (usually 16 to 32 pounds) or miniature (11 pounds or under), Dachshunds aren't built for distance running, leaping, or strenuous swimming, but otherwise these tireless hounds are game for anything.
