## Project Name Trivia

The Eurasier is a medium-sized dog with a thick, medium-long coat that can come in a variety of colors. Confident, calm, and well-balanced, he is loyal to the entire family, but reserved towards strangers. He must live in close contact with his family, as he is not suited to be kept in kennels or tied up outside. 

Eurasiers can have purple tongues, pink tongues or spotted tongues. They can also have dark face masks or light, so-called reverse masks. Eurasiers are calm, even-tempered, gentle, loving, intelligent and confident.
